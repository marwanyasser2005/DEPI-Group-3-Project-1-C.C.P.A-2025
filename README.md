# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction & Analysis (C.C.P.A)

Welcome to our Machine Learning project repository focused on **Customer Churn Prediction** using advanced data science workflows, MLOps, and interactive visualization.

---

## 🧠 Project Description
Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. This project aims to predict which customers are likely to churn based on usage behavior and demographics, enabling companies to proactively retain valuable customers.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- **Visualization**: seaborn, matplotlib, plotly
- **Model Management**: MLflow
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Web App
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code

---

## 🔍 Workflow Overview
### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned missing/invalid values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Engineered features like `AvgCharges`, `Engagement`

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized churn counts and correlations
- Discovered patterns through heatmaps and count plots

### 3. **Model Development**
- Trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Final model: **Random Forest** with best performance
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

### 4. **MLOps with MLflow**
- Tracked experiments and metrics
- Logged model versions and parameters

### 5. **Deployment**
- Built an interactive web dashboard using **Streamlit**
- User input form allows real-time predictions
